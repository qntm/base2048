# CHANGELOG

## 2.x.x

`base2048` now ships as JavaScript ("ES6") modules, not CommonJS modules. The package has `"type": "module"`. Additionally a separate IIFE for browser use is no longer distributed.

## 1.x.x

`base2048` now operates on `Uint8Array`s, not `ArrayBuffer`s.

## 0.0.x

Prototype release.
